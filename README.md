# NatureOverhaul
This is the Nature Overhaul PC mod but converted to Object Spawner format so it can be used with DayZ Console. It also addresses a placment issue with the P3d references. It is above 99% the same as the PC mod.

There are currently 4 versions of Nature overhaul.

2 lite versions and 2 full versions. 

Each type has a version with offsets and one with no offsets. 

The versions with offsets fix a height issue with trees. 
* NatureOverhaulConsoleDayZ (with offsets)
* LiteWithOffSets

The versions with no offsets dont have that fix applied. this is incase the game fixes it in future
* LiteNoOffsets
* FullVersion_NoOffsets

# Donations
I've been asked by a few people how to donate to me.

I donâ€™t  really like promoting that sort of thing, but here are a couple of ways to do so if you wish to.
Costs will go towards DayZ server costs and general content creation/streaming.

Thank you!
