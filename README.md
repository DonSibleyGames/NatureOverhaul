# NatureOverhaul
This is the Nature Overhaul PC mod but converted to Object Spawner format so it can be used with DayZ Console. It also addresses a placment issue with the P3d references. It is above 99% the same as the PC mod.

There are currently 4 versions of Nature overhaul.
2 lite versions and 2 full versions. 
Each type has a version with offsets and one with no offsets. 
The versions with offsets fix a height issue with trees. 
The versions with no offsets dont have that fix applied. this is incase the game fixes it in future
